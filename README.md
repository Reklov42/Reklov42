# Go brrr
Hi, I'm @R, the guy who writes things that don't need to be written, like OS for the i8086, programming languages, real-time rendering and physics for game engines and so on.

C/C++ is my primary programming languages, but I also use Node.JS, Python, Lua, NASM, and other languages.<br>
(~~DO NOT ASK WHY I KNOW FORTH~~)

I really like real-time rendering, so I know OpenGL 2.0, Core Profile up to 4.6, ES 3.0 and also learning Vulkan.

<sup><sup>(idk what else to write)</sup></sup>
